# Fluorescence_spotfinder
Collaboration space for fluorescence ROI spot finder code.
Python code contained within this collaboration space relates directly to my PhD thesis work involving analysis of TIRF microscopy images. The purpose of this code is to be able to have customisable fluorescence and pixel area thresholds to identify and categorise fluorescent ROIs from raw .czi microscopy images, and output information regarding number of ROIs, average ROI sizes and areas. 
This analysis method is open source and is used by the Matthew Baker lab at UNSW.
